Script, 3-D models, and schematics used to design the project

See Rock Candy Maker P&ID Spec Sheet Uploadable for more detailed equipment list; the following is in Layman's terms for hobbyists and includes tools and non-electronics used to assemble the project that are not relavent to the engineering aspect


Hardware: Elegoo UNO R3, 3 relay modules, 12V 100W heating element (JUMPER WIRES CANNOT HANDLE MORE THAN 2A, I split the wires the came with the heating element and used those wires), 12V 8A barrel plug wall outlet adapter for heating element, Positional servo motor 12V DC self-priming pump, 12V DC motor for stir bar (more powerful than is needed, ideally should ba a 5V motor), Ultrasonic sensor (Accurate with more than ~5cm distance from echo), 2 12V 2A barrel plug wall outlet adapters for arduino power supply and 12V pump and 12V DC motor, 2 barrel plug to cable wire ends adapters, Thermocouple with amplifier 12V normally closed solonoid valve 2 NPN Transistors PN2222 2 10 Ohm resistors Flyback diode 3V vibration motor

Misc electronics: Soldering iron Male-Female jumper cables Male-Male jumper cables Breadboard USB-B to USB-A cable

Additional items: 3-D printed sugar wheel and platform for dispensing sugar, Hot glue, Sealing heat resistant epoxy, Neodymium magnets, Magnetic stir bar, PVC piping, Sugar water cup (shortened bottle to fit under solonoid valve), Sugar tank (Chipotle soda cup), Water tank (Measuring cup), Wood to make overall structure, Aluminum cooking pot, 1/4" NPT pipe and a 1/4" NPT bolt
