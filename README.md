# Automated-Rock-Candy-Maker
Script, 3-D models, and schematics used to design the project

Hardware: Elegoo UNO R3 3 relay modules 12V 100W heating element (JUMPER WIRES CANNOT HANDLE MORE THAN 2A, I split the wires the came with the heating element and used those wires) 12V 8A barrel plug wall outlet adapter for heating element Positional servo motor 12V DC self-priming pump 12V DC motor for stir bar (more powerful than is needed, ideally should ba a 5V motor) Ultrasonic sensor (nearly useless, works better with more than ~5cm distance from echo surface) 2 12V 2A barrel plug wall outlet adapters for arduino power supply and 12V pump and motor 2 barrel plug to cable wire ends adapters Thermocouple with amplifier 12V normally closed solonoid valve 2 NPN Transistors PN2222 2 10 Ohm resistors Flyback diode 3V vibration motor

Misc electronics: Soldering iron Male-Female jumper cables Male-Male jumper cables Breadboard USB-B to USB-A cable

Additional items: 3-D printed sugar wheel and platform for dispensing sugar Hot glue gun Sealing heat resistant epoxy Neodymium magnets and stir bar PVC piping Sugar water cup (shortened bottle to fit under solonoid valve) Sugar tank (Chipotle soda cup) Water tank (Measuring cup) Wood to make overall structure and stir motor mount Cooking pot Short 1/4" NPT pipe and a 1/4" NPT bolt
